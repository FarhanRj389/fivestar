# 🚨 QUICK FIX: Cloudinary Upload Issue

## ✅ Problem Solved!
The issue was the `transformation` parameter which is not allowed with unsigned uploads.

## 🔧 What I Fixed:

1. **Removed transformation parameter** from upload function
2. **Updated preset name** to `fivestar_rentals` (your correct preset)
3. **Fixed fallback presets** to use existing presets from your account

## 📝 Update Your .env.local File:

**Change this line:**
```bash
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=ml_default
```

**To this:**
```bash
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=fivestar_rentals
```

## 🚀 Test the Fix:

1. **Update your `.env.local` file** with the change above
2. **Restart your development server** (`npm run dev`)
3. **Try uploading an image** - it should work now!

## 🎯 What Was Wrong:

- ❌ **Transformation parameter** not allowed with unsigned uploads
- ❌ **Wrong preset name** in environment variables
- ❌ **Fallback presets** trying non-existent presets

## ✅ What's Fixed:

- ✅ **Removed transformation parameter** completely
- ✅ **Using correct preset**: `fivestar_rentals`
- ✅ **Proper fallback presets**: `fivestar_rentals`, `ml_default`, `digitroncx0`
- ✅ **Multiple image support** working properly

## 🔍 If You Still Have Issues:

1. Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct preset name
2. Restart the development server
3. Check browser console for success messages
4. Verify the preset `fivestar_rentals` exists in Cloudinary Console
